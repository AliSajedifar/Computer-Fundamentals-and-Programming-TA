# 🧩 Session 03 — Algorithms & Flowcharts

In this session, students learned:
- what an algorithm is,
- the meaning of well-formed (well-defined) algorithms,
- why we use flowcharts,
- advantages of visual modeling,
- and the three fundamental control structures.

A set of flowchart-based exercises were also solved during class.

## 🔌 1. What Is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a **finite, step-by-step procedure** for solving a problem or performing a task.

A correct algorithm must be:
- **Well-defined** → every step is clear, unambiguous.
- **Finite** → must end in a limited number of steps.
- **Input-defined** → may receive zero or more inputs.
- **Output-producing** → must produce at least one result.
- **Effective** → each step must be doable and precise.

Example (conceptually):  
An algorithm for making tea is a sequence of clear steps with a defined start and end.

## 🧠 2. What Does “Well-Formed Algorithm” Mean?

A **well-formed (well-structured) algorithm** satisfies:
- clarity → no unclear instructions,
- determinism → same input always gives same output,
- executability → steps must be practical,
- order → steps must follow a meaningful sequence.

If any step is vague or contradictory, the algorithm is **not** well-formed.

## 🔧 3. Why Do We Use Flowcharts?

Flowcharts are **visual representations** of algorithms.

### Benefits:
- easier to read and understand,
- ideal for beginners,
- helps in debugging logical mistakes,
- provides a clear overview of control flow,
- useful before writing actual C++ code.

Flowcharts use standard symbols:
- oval → start/end  
- parallelogram → input/output  
- rectangle → process  
- diamond → decision

## 🔀 4. Fundamental Control Structures

All programs (in any language) are made from just **three control structures**:

### 1️⃣ Sequence Structure  
Steps executed **one after another** in order.

### 2️⃣ Selection Structure (Decision)  
Program chooses a path based on a condition.  
Example: if / else

### 3️⃣ Repetition Structure (Loop)  
A set of steps repeats while a condition is true.  
Example: while, for

Understanding these structures is essential for both writing algorithms and drawing flowcharts.

## 📘 5. In-Class Exercises (Flowchart Practice)

The following problems were solved during class using **flowcharts**.  
Students were required to design the steps visually using decision and repetition symbols.

---

### ✅ Exercise 1  
Design an algorithm that receives a number and checks whether it is divisible by **3 and 5**.

---

### ✅ Exercise 2  
Write an algorithm that reads **5 numbers** from the user and prints their **average**.

---

### ✅ Exercise 3  
Write an algorithm that computes the **sum of all even numbers** from 1 to n.

---

### ✅ Exercise 4  
Write an algorithm that receives a number and computes its **factorial**.

---

### ✅ Exercise 5  
Write an algorithm that checks whether the user input is **Prime** or not.

---

### ✅ Exercise 6  
Write an algorithm that reads n from the user and prints the **n-th Fibonacci number**.

## 🎯 End of Session

This session introduced:
- the foundation of algorithm design,  
- well-structured thinking,  
- flowchart modeling,  
- and control structures.

These concepts form the basis for writing actual C++ programs in upcoming sessions.
