# 🧩 Session 07 — Conditional Statements and Loops in C++

This session focused on **decision making** and **repetition structures** in C++.  
All topics and exercises were covered in an **interactive, practice-oriented manner**, with continuous student participation and conceptual discussion while solving problems.

---

## 🔁 1. Review — Logical Expressions

The session began with a short review of:
- logical expressions,
- comparison operators,
- logical operators (AND, OR, NOT),
- how conditions evaluate to `true` or `false`.

This review prepared students for using conditions inside control structures.

---

## 🔀 2. Conditional Structure — if / else if / else

The **if–else if–else** structure was explained conceptually:
- how conditions are evaluated in order,
- how only one branch is executed,
- why order of conditions matters.

Examples were discussed step-by-step to clarify program flow.

---

### ✅ Exercise 1 — Compare Two Numbers
Write a program that reads **two numbers** and compares them.

The program determines whether:
- the first number is greater,
- the second number is greater,
- or both numbers are equal.

---

### ✅ Exercise 2 — Even and Greater Than 10
Write a program that reads a number and checks whether it is:
- **even**, and
- **greater than 10**.

This exercise reinforced:
- combining conditions using logical AND,
- writing clear and readable conditional statements.

---

## 🔁 3. Multiple Choice Conditions — switch

The **switch** statement was introduced and explained:
- it is used for **multiple comparisons of a single variable**,
- in some cases it is cleaner and more readable than multiple `if` statements,
- each `case` represents a specific value.

Typical use cases of `switch` were discussed.

---

### ✅ Exercise 3 — Day of the Week
Write a program that reads a number and prints the **name of the day of the week**.

Rules:
- numbers 1 to 7 represent valid days,
- if the input is outside this range, print an error message.

This problem was solved using a `switch` statement to improve clarity and structure.

---

## 🔄 4. Repetition Structure — while Loop

The **while** loop was explained conceptually:
- how the condition is checked before each iteration,
- how the loop continues while the condition is true,
- when a loop stops executing.

---

### ✅ Exercise 4 — Print Numbers from 1 to 5
This problem was solved in **two different ways**:

1. Using an index variable with condition `i <= 5`.
2. Using an infinite loop (`true`) and exiting with `break`.

The concept of an **infinite loop** was discussed, including:
- why it can be dangerous,
- how to safely exit using `break`,
- when such patterns may be useful.

---

### ✅ Exercise 5 — Sum of Digits
Write a program that reads a number and prints the **sum of its digits**.

This exercise combined:
- loops,
- division and modulo operations,
- step-by-step digit extraction.

---

## 🔁 5. Repetition Structure — do while Loop

The **do–while** loop was introduced conceptually.

Key difference from `while`:
- the `do` block **always executes at least once**,
- the condition is checked **after** execution.

Typical use cases were discussed where at least one execution is required.

---

## 🎯 End of Session

All problems in this session were solved **interactively**, with students actively participating in:
- designing conditions,
- predicting outputs,
- correcting logic,
- and reasoning about loop behavior.

By the end of Session 07, students were able to:
- use conditional structures (`if`, `else if`, `else`),
- apply `switch` for multiple-choice logic,
- write `while` and `do–while` loops,
- understand infinite loops and safe exits,
- solve loop-based problems such as digit summation.
