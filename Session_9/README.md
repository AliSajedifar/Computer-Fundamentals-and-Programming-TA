# 🧩 Session 09 — for Loop, Nested Loops, and Functions

This session continued the practice-oriented approach of previous classes.  
All topics were reviewed and developed **interactively**, with students actively participating in writing, analyzing, and improving programs step-by-step.

---

## 🔁 1. Review — if and while

The session began with a short review of:
- the `if` conditional structure,
- the `while` loop,
- how conditions control program flow.

This review prepared students for more structured repetition using `for`.

---

## 🔢 2. GCD Using while (Euclidean Algorithm)

### In-Class Practice
Write a program that reads **two numbers** and computes their **GCD** using a `while` loop.

The **Euclidean Algorithm** was applied step-by-step:
- repeatedly replace the larger number with the remainder,
- continue until the remainder becomes zero.

This reinforced:
- loop-based problem solving,
- using conditions to control repetition.

---

## 🔂 3. for Loop — Concept and Structure

It was explained that in many problems, we already know **how many times a loop should run**.  
In such cases, using a `for` loop is often **cleaner and more readable** than `while`.

The structure of the `for` loop was explained conceptually:

- **Initialization (I)** — executed once at the beginning  
- **Condition (C)** — checked before each iteration  
- **Update (U)** — executed after each iteration  

---

## 🔢 4. for Loop Practice

### ✅ Example 1 — Count from 1 to 5
A program was written to print numbers from **1 to 5** using a `for` loop.

Focus:
- correct loop bounds,
- clean and compact structure.

---

### ✅ Example 2 — Sum from 1 to n
Write a program that computes:

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n

using a `for` loop.

This problem emphasized:
- accumulation patterns,
- correct initialization of the sum variable.

---

## 🔁 5. Nested Loops

Nested loops were introduced and explained conceptually.

The idea that:
- the **inner loop** completes fully for each iteration of the **outer loop**
was emphasized using examples.

---

### ✅ Example 3 — Multiplication Table (1 to 4)
Write a program that prints the multiplication table from **1 to 4**.

This problem demonstrated:
- nested loop execution order,
- structured output formatting.

---

### ✅ Example 4 — Star Triangle Pattern
Write a program that prints the following pattern:

*
**
***
****

This was solved using **nested for loops**, reinforcing:
- loop control,
- pattern-based thinking.

---

## 🧠 6. Why Functions?

A key question was discussed:
> If we need the same code in multiple places, should we copy and paste it?

This led to the introduction of **functions**.

Functions were explained conceptually:
- they group reusable logic,
- improve readability,
- reduce duplication.

---

## 🔧 7. Function Basics

The following concepts were explained:
- function **definition**,
- **return type**,
- **parameters**,
- where functions should be defined in a C++ program.

---

### ✅ Function Examples
Two simple examples were discussed:
- a function that returns the **sum of two numbers**,
- a function that prints a **single line of output**.

These examples helped clarify the difference between:
- functions that return values,
- functions that only perform actions.

---

## 🔍 8. Variable Scope

The concept of **variable scope** was introduced.

Students learned:
- where variables are visible,
- why variables declared inside a function are not accessible outside,
- common problems caused by incorrect scope usage.

The importance of defining variables in the correct scope was emphasized.

---

## 🎯 End of Session

All topics in this session were covered **interactively**, with continuous student involvement in:
- loop reasoning,
- algorithm design,
- pattern generation,
- function decomposition,
- and understanding variable scope.

This session built a strong foundation for writing **structured, reusable, and readable C++ programs**.
