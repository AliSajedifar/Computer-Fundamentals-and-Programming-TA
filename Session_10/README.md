# 🧩 Session 10 — Functions and Control Flow (In-Class Coding)

This session was conducted as a **fully interactive coding session**.  
All concepts were explained verbally while writing and executing code live.  
Students actively participated by predicting outputs, modifying logic, and testing different cases.

---

## 🔁 1. Review — Functions and Control Flow

The session reinforced previously learned concepts:
- conditional structures,
- loops,
- and the idea of breaking programs into reusable parts using functions.

---

## 🔧 2. Void Functions and Return Values

The difference between:
- **void functions** (perform an action, no return value),
- and functions that **return a value**,

was explained conceptually.

A utility function was used to print a separator line, reinforcing the idea of reusable code.

---

## 🔢 3. Boolean Functions

Boolean functions were introduced and practiced.

### In-Class Examples
- `isEven(int num)`  
  Returns whether a number is even.

- `isPrime(int num)`  
  Determines whether a number is prime using a loop.

These examples emphasized:
- returning logical results,
- using functions inside conditions,
- separating logic from input/output.

---

## 🧾 4. Function with Parameters (User Information)

A function was written that:
- receives a name and an age,
- computes the year of birth,
- prints a formatted sentence.

This example reinforced:
- parameter passing,
- local variables inside functions,
- practical use of functions for real tasks.

---

## 🔁 5. Nested Loops with Functions (Pattern Printing)

Several pattern-printing functions were implemented using **nested loops**.

### Implemented Patterns
- Square pattern  
- Triangle pattern  
- Reversed triangle pattern  

Each pattern was implemented as a **separate function**, reinforcing:
- decomposition of logic,
- reuse of loop structures,
- clarity and readability.

---

## 🔷 6. Combining Functions

A more complex pattern was built by **combining two existing functions**:
- a triangle,
- followed by a reversed triangle.

This demonstrated how small functions can be composed to create more complex behavior.

---

## ⛔ 7. break Statement

The `break` statement was practiced using a loop that:
- repeatedly reads numbers from the user,
- stops execution when the user enters `0`.

This example reinforced:
- controlled exit from loops,
- safe termination conditions.

---

## ⏭️ 8. continue Statement

The `continue` statement was introduced.

### In-Class Practice
- read several numbers in a loop,
- skip negative numbers,
- process only valid inputs.

This demonstrated:
- skipping the current iteration,
- maintaining loop flow without terminating it.

---

## 🎯 End of Session

All demos and exercises in this session were solved **interactively**, with students actively involved in:
- designing and testing functions,
- understanding return values,
- applying nested loops,
- using `break` and `continue`,
- and structuring programs in a clean and modular way.

This session strengthened students’ understanding of **functions as building blocks** of C++ programs.
