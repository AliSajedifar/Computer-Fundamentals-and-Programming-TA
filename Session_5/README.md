# 🧩 Session 05 — First C++ Program, Variables, and Operators

This session marked the transition from algorithms and flowcharts to writing actual C++ code.  
The class was conducted in an **interactive manner**, with continuous questions, discussion, and conceptual guidance while students actively participated in solving problems.

---

## 🔁 1. Conceptual Review

The session started with a short conceptual review connecting the following ideas:

- **Idea** → what we want to solve  
- **Algorithm** → step-by-step solution  
- **Flowchart** → visual representation of logic  
- **Program (C++)** → implementation of the algorithm  
- **Executable file** → result of compilation  
- **Run** → executing the program  

The difference between **Build** and **Run** inside an IDE was explained:

- **Build** → translate code into an executable file (compile)  
- **Run** → execute the already-built program  

---

## 💻 2. Writing the First C++ Program

The basic structure of a C++ program was written and explained **conceptually**, not memorized.

The following components were introduced:

- `#include <iostream>`  
  Explained as importing input/output tools required for communication with the user.

- `using namespace std;`  
  Explained as a way to avoid repeatedly writing `std::` and simplify code readability.

Students were guided to understand **why** these lines are needed, not just how to write them.

---

## 🖨️ 3. Output in C++ (cout)

The `cout` statement was introduced as:
- the tool for printing output to the screen,
- a way for the program to communicate results to the user.

Multiple simple examples were discussed interactively.

---

## 🧠 4. Variables and Memory Concept

A **variable** was explained conceptually as:
- a named location in memory,
- a container that stores a value,
- a way to access and modify data during program execution.

The connection between variables and **RAM** was emphasized to build correct mental models.

---

## 🔢 5. Data Types in C++

Common data types were introduced and compared:

- `int` → integers  
- `float` / `double` → decimal numbers  
- `char` → single characters  
- `bool` → true / false values  

The idea that **data type determines how much memory is used and how data is interpreted** was highlighted.

---

## ✍️ 6. Variable Naming Rules

Rules and best practices for naming variables were discussed:

- must start with a letter or underscore  
- cannot contain spaces  
- cannot be a reserved keyword  
- meaningful names improve readability  

Examples of good vs bad naming were discussed with students.

---

## 📘 7. In-Class Programming Exercises

These problems were solved **during class with student participation**, focusing on reasoning rather than copying solutions.

---

### ✅ Exercise 1 — Circle Perimeter
Write a program that computes the **perimeter of a circle** with radius 4.

The goal was to:
- define variables,
- use constants,
- apply a mathematical formula correctly.

---

### ✅ Exercise 2 — Sum of Two Numbers (User Input)
Write a program that reads **two numbers** from the user and prints their **sum**.

This exercise introduced:
- `cin` for input,
- interaction between user and program.

---

### ✅ Exercise 3 — Birth Year Calculation
Write a program that reads the user’s **age** and computes their **year of birth**.

The exercise reinforced:
- variable usage,
- arithmetic operations,
- input/output flow.

---

## ➕➖ 8. Operators in C++

The following operators were explained with multiple examples:

### Arithmetic Operators
- `+  -  *  /  %`

### Increment and Decrement
- `++` and `--`
- difference between prefix and postfix usage (conceptually)

---

## 🔗 9. Logical Operators

Logical operators were introduced with **clear examples and truth tables**:

- AND (`&&`)  
- OR (`||`)  
- NOT (`!`)  

Students practiced reasoning about conditions rather than memorizing results.

---

## 🧮 10. Built-in Mathematical Functions

Common built-in functions were introduced:

- `min`, `max`  
- functions from the `cmath` library such as:
  - `sqrt`
  - `pow`
  - `abs`

The need to include the proper library and how to use these functions correctly was explained with examples.

---

## 🎯 End of Session

By the end of this session, students:
- wrote their first complete C++ programs,
- understood how code is built and run inside an IDE,
- learned how variables map to memory,
- used input/output,
- applied arithmetic, logical, and built-in operations,
- and actively participated in an interactive learning environment.

Next session: **Conditional Statements (if / else) and Decision Making in C++**.
