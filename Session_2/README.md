# 🧩 Session 02 — Algorithms & Flowcharts

This session briefly covered:
- the definition of an algorithm,
- meaning of “well-defined steps,”
- why flowcharts are used to visualize logic,
- how algorithms translate into flowchart diagrams.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered (Very Short Summary)

- What an algorithm is and why we write it before coding.
- How a flowchart represents the steps of an algorithm visually.
- Basic flowchart symbols (Start/End, Input/Output, Process, Decision).

## 📝 Class Exercises (Explained in Session)

1. Draw a flowchart for an algorithm that:
   - Takes two numbers as input,
   - Swaps their values.

2. Draw a flowchart for an algorithm that:
   - Takes two numbers as input,
   - Swaps their values **without using a temporary variable**.

3. Draw a flowchart for an algorithm that:
   - Takes three numbers (x, y, z),
   - Determines the largest number,
   - Prints the largest value.

4. Draw a flowchart for an algorithm that:
   - Computes the sum of the series:
     1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 50

5. Draw a flowchart for an algorithm that:
   - Computes the sum of the series:
     1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n

6. Draw a flowchart for an algorithm that:
   - Takes a number from the user,
   - Counts how many digits it has,
   - Prints the digit count.
